# E-commerce Delivery Analytics using Python
A complete data analytics project exploring customer behavior, delivery performance, and service outcomes in an e-commerce delivery context.

# Overview
This project investigates a 100,000-order [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/logiccraftbyhimanshi/e-commerce-analytics-swiggy-zomato-blinkit) from an e-commerce delivery platform. The objective is to identify operational inefficiencies, understand customer sentiment, and predict refund behavior using structured data and text feedback.

Through detailed exploratory analysis and predictive modeling, the project offers insights that support business decisions in logistics, customer experience, and platform strategy.

# Key Focus Areas
Customer Behavior:

Repeat order analysis

Average spend per customer

Operational Performance:

Delivery time comparison by product category and platform

Delay and refund patterns

Platform Insights:

Revenue contribution by platform and category

Balance between service ratings and delivery speed (Z-score evaluation)

Customer Sentiment:

Keyword analysis in low-rated feedback

Text-based sentiment scoring using VADER

Predictive Modeling:

Logistic regression to predict refund requests

Integration of sentiment as a predictive feature

# Tools & Techniques Used
Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, NLTK, Seaborn, Matplotlib)

Sentiment Analysis (VADER)

Statistical Methods (Kendallâ€™s Tau, Spearman, Z-score)

Modeling: Logistic Regression, Classification Metrics

Data Visualization: Word clouds, Histograms, Bar charts, ROC curves

# Deliverables
A structured, documented Jupyter notebook

Power BI dashboards (optional if built)

Cleaned dataset with sentiment and prediction outputs

Final report and slide-ready visuals

LaTeX-formatted technical report (optional inclusion)

# Outcomes
This project provides data-driven answers to common operational and CX questions:

What drives refunds?

Which platforms perform best?

How do customers express dissatisfaction?

Can we predict service failures in advance?

The findings are useful for logistics teams, CX managers, and data product owners seeking to enhance platform operations through data insights.
